## General Information
This project aims to solve the struggle that many new graduate students are faced with: finding a job. In a world where AI and bots are used to quickly
screen out candidiates, they deserve a chance to utilize the same strategies to increase application throughput, alongside their odds at landing an 
interview. I took this project on so that I, alongside my peers, can optimize our search for work.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11.0
- Selenium WebDriver - version 4.5.0


## Features

- Flexibility in

`chrome_driver_path` and hit run!



## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- As of now, only one page can be parsed at a time by the script; ideally, I would like there to be functionality for more
- Code will break if LinkedIn changes their source code drastically enough for HTML elements to be renamed or re-formatted

TODO:
- Implement page parsing on LinkedIn to allow users further control in the amount of job they wish to apply for 
- Develop a more robust means of finding key page elements, which is not subject to change based on website updates
